Okay, so, this might be slightly awkward. Bear with me. To cut to the point, I've realized recently that I kind of "like" you - like, the bullshit term used by teenagers to mean "unreasonbly attracted to some specific individual of (usually) the opposite gender", that type of like. This is making me uncomfortable. Mostly because it's an emotion. I don't like those much, especially when they're kind of weird and have some sort of impact on my life and specifically the way I act. I feel a need to clarify: this weird and pretty minor attraction has _not_ influenced the way I act. (Why do I say that? Because I can imagine a scenario n which I say this and you're all like Oh-my-god-no-wonder-you-acted-like-blah-blah-blah-that-makes-it-so-awkward --  uh, no.... not the case)So, note that I'm not "askiong you out" or some such. That seems to me like a particularly arrogant thing to do, since it implies some random other crap. I am simply (for once) being honest. Also, I don't like it. (Lesson learned: honesty is unpleasant).  So my purpose really is to get rid of that weird crap going on in my mind and not let stupid teenage emotions influence stuff; oh, and I realize I'm being kind of a bitch my somehow involving you in this. Sorry about that. Also, by mentioning this at all I'm kind of relying on you not actually being a bitch... I... think that's a safe assumption? Not completely sure... My own personal assumption (and conclusion) is that I should leave and keep you out of that messed up emotional part of my life. Am I right? (oh, and brb)
